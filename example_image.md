Defining comorbidities/covariates
=================================

Having reviewed the baseline data from a set of clinical trials from the YODA repository, the following data have been found to be available.

| Information type           | Number of trials |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| Age and sex                | 37               |
| Height and weight (or BMI) | 32               |
| Blood pressure             | 27               |
| Concomitant medication     | 37               |
| Medical history            | 22               |
| Laboratory results         | 34               |

Based on an examination of these covariate data (without having examined outcome or treatment allocation data) we will adopt the comorbidity/covariate definitions for all trials across the YODA, NIH BioLINCC and CSDR repositories, and any subsequent repositories.

Age
===

Age in years will be standardised to the mean and standard deviation for age from the US National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), 2015-16. Data and documentation at *<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015>.* For both the main effect and interaction with treatment, age will be modelled as a continuous variable. Details of the approach for modelling continuous variables are given at the end of this document.

Sex
===

Sex will be coded as 1 for female and 0 for male. This has been chosen as historically there has been greater interest in whether treatments tested in predominantly male populations are equally effective in women.

Race/Ethnicity
==============

We did not previously apply for race or ethnicity variables, but will do so in subsequent applications to trial repositories. In the main analysis we will examine race.Ethnicity will be included only in a secondary analysis.

In the absence of an international consensus, we will collapse race categories to correspond to the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and White) as described in the FDA guidelines for race/ethnicity in clinical trials.(1) We will map other terms to these categories using the “roll-up” scheme shown in Figure 3.3 of the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on “Race, Ethnicity, and Language Data: Standardization for Health Care Quality Improvement”. The roll-up given in the FDA recommendation is a subset of that in the IOM report, containing fewer terms. Terms not found in this list will be classified as “Other”.

In the IOM report, the use of OMB categories are described as reasonable “when an analyst needs a consistent set of minimum categories to make comparisons across systems”.(2) As such, their use seems appropriate for our analysis.

We acknowledge that the OMB categories, and the mappings, were designed for a US context, and may be less appropriate in other settings. Nonetheless, we have opted to use these because FDA policy is influential internationally as regards trial design and conduct. Moreover, we been unable to find guidance on this topic from equivalent organisations in other countries or federations.

Of the 2172 trials selected for this research and registered on the PROSPERO systematic review register website, 350 reported baseline counts according to race on clinicaltrials.gov. We collapsed these according to the IOM rollup to OMB categories. Figure 1 shows the percentage of participants within each OMB category for each trial. Where a trial reported counts aggregated across 2 or more OMB categories (eg “White or Asian - 103 participants”) we counted both. As such, the proportion of participants in each category is known to be an overestimate.

On the basis of this observed distribution, we will use “White” as the reference category, as this is the commonest grouping, with indicator variables for “Asian”, “Black or African American”. We will also use a single indicator variable of “Other” for the remaining categories as these are uncommon.

Socio-economic status
=====================

So far, no measure of socio-economic status (eg income, educational level, deprivation scores) has been recorded in any of the commercial trials examined.

Reported medical history
========================

We will not use the reported medical history to **define** comorbidities.

This is because of incomplete reporting and the fact that the medical history data varies considerably between trials in terms of collection (for example, there are frequently specific questions for diseases closely related to the main outcome and only broad screening questions for unrelated diseases) and recording. An additional difficulty is that some sponsors redact the condition data to preserve privacy. Consequently, this data will only be used as a check on the definitions described in the following sections.

Concomitant medications based definitions
=========================================

It is also likely that trials will differ in the accuracy and completeness of concomitant medicine data recording. For example, compared to other trials, respiratory trials may be more likely to identify inhaled therapies.

Nevertheless, obtaining a yes/no drug history is intrinsically less complex than taking a past medical history. Moreover, concomitant medications are assigned to World Health Organisation Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (WHO-ATC) codes in a consistent manner across trials. The WHO ATC system is organised around indications, and for some drug classes it is reasonable to infer that a trial participant has one or more of a narrow set of diseases (eg reporting use of thyroid drugs indicates the presence of thyroid disease). Therefore, we will use concomitant medications to identify comorbid conditions.

Previous studies have also used the WHO ATC criteria to define comorbid diseases, but usually in routine healthcare data with the goal being descriptive epidemiology, as in a recent paper by Huber et al.(3) We are not aware of any previous study which has used this approach for individual-level participant data from clinical trials, or to examine heterogeneity of treatment effects. We have therefore created a set of definitions substantially different from previous reports, reflecting our need for greater specificity (Table 1).

For each of the drug-based definitions in Table 1, reported concomitant medications are eligible if they were started at any time on or before starting the trial drug (or comparator) regardless of when they were stopped. Topical drugs are not included in the definitions except for M02 or S01E. Nor drugs with an inhaled or nebulised route of administration, except for R03 drugs.

This approach to defining comorbidities is a compromise between sensitivity and specificity and some misclassification is inevitable, reflecting the difficulty of inferring diagnoses from drug-usage. We have attempted to minimise the misclassification based on our understanding of clinical practice.

For example, rather than assuming all participants taking a drug in the A02B class have an acid-related disorder (Table 1) we have limited this definition to exclude participants also taking non-steroidal drugs or any drug with anti-thrombotic actions (aspirin, antiplatelets, warfarin etc). Similarly, we have not used aspirin to define cardiovascular disease because it is in widespread use for primary prevention.(4)

Moreover, while the ATC system is organised around therapeutic indications, not all indications are coded. This is because “A medicinal substance can be given more than one ATC code \[**ONLY**\] if it is available in two or more strengths or routes of administration with clearly different therapeutic uses.”(5) For example, finasteride is classified as a dermatological drug if low-dose and as a drug for benign prostatic hyperplasia if high-dose. Therefore, for a single strength and route of administration, there is only “one code, the main indication being decided on the basis of the available information.” (5)

Moreover, the “main” WHO ATC indication is not necessarily the commonest indication. For example, in a US study of drug “mentions” in a representative database, &gt;80% of mentions for gabapentin and amitriptyline were for off-label indications, predominantly pain.(6) Similarly, in a Canadian study of antidepressant use in primary care, amitriptyline was “almost exclusively prescribed for off-label indications” most commonly for pain, insomnia, and migraine.(7) These published findings are consistent with the clinical observation of members of our steering committee (and an independent epileptologist), that these drugs are predominantly used for pain. Despite this, the WHO ATC scheme does not include pain as an indication for these drugs, classifying gabapentin and pregabalin exclusively as antiepileptics and amitriptyline exclusively as an antidepressant.

Nor is there necessarily a code where routes/strengths do differ. For example, prochlorperazine is defined solely as an antipsychotic, despite being available in a buccal preparation for nausea. IN this case the accompanying note states that “The substances in this group are sometimes used for other indications in much lower doses”.

We have attempted to incorporate these nuances into the drug-based comorbidity definitions given in Table 1.

An additional complexity is caused by the fact that for certain trials, sponsors have only provided less specific codes (eg 3 or 4-character codes) and not 5-character codes which uniquely identify each class (7-character codes identifying each agent). Where this is the case, but the drug name with or without route and indication information have been provided, we will assign each potentially-relevant drug to a WHO ATC code using the US Government drug metathesaurus (RXNORM). Where neither the drug name, nor sufficiently detailed drug-class information is provided, we will adopt a workaround suited to each definition (Table 1). The number of trials where this approach was needed will be reported.

The proportion of participants with and without comorbid diseases based on concomitant medications with and without relevant medical histories (in trials where these have been provided) will be compared in 2x2 contingency tables. We expect to find a higher proportion with the relevant condition from the reported medical history among those participants meeting the concomitant medication definitions (eg 80% versus 10% reporting diabetes in participants taking/not taking antidiabetic medications).

Height and weight
=================

We will use body mass index (BMI) where this is provided, or calculate it from the weight and height (weight in kg/height in meters-squared). Where multiple BMI measures are available, we will use the last BMI measured just prior to the initiation of the intervention. BMI will be standardised to the BMI in the adult population from NHANES 2015-16 (see Blood Pressure section for details). We will treat BMI as a continuous variable in the modelling.

Blood pressure
==============

In the largest study of blood pressure, a meta-analysis of 958,074 participants from 61 prospective studies, mid-blood pressure (0.5 x DBP + 0.5 \* SBP) performed slightly better than SBP alone for both stroke and ischaemic heart disease risk.(8) Consequently, we will use this measure in our models.

In a simulation study, with SBP as the outcome variable, Tobin et al demonstrated that adding a suitable constant (eg 10mmHg) for patients taking anti-hypertensive reduced bias as well as any of several more complex methods, whereas including a dummy variable for treatment introduced bias.(9) We will use this approach for SBP as a covariate in the covariate-treatment interaction models, under the assumption that the true underlying blood pressure is most relevant to the analysis. We will similarly add a constant of 5 mmHg to the diastolic blood pressure. Both constants will be added prior to calculating the mid-blood pressure.

If a participant is taking a drug from any of the following drug classes prior to initiating the study drug we will perform the correction; C02 – ANTIHYPERTENSIVES, C07 - beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents, C08 - CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS or C09 - AGENTS ACTING ON THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM. We will perform the correction only once regardless of the number of different antihypertensive drugs any participant is taking, and regardless of whether the drug was given for hypertension or a different indication (eg a calcium channel blocker for angina).

Since blood pressure shows considerable within-person variability, we will take the mean of all measures obtained prior to initiation of the drug (ie those from screening and randomisation visits). Having done so we will standardise the blood pressure results to the adult blood pressure results from NHANES 2015-16 (Table 2).

### Table 2 Adult (aged &gt;=18) NHANES 2015-16 blood pressure averaged over (up to) 3 recordings

| Blood Pressure | Mean | Standard deviation |
|----------------|------|--------------------|
| Diastolic      | 70   | 12                 |
| Systolic       | 123  | 17                 |

For data see [*https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015*](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015).

Laboratory test based definitions
=================================

Liver impairment
----------------

We will use the Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index to examine for the presence of liver disease. FIB4 will be calculated as follows:-

$$FIB4 = \\ \\frac{age\\  \\times AST}{platelet\\ count\\  \\times \\ \\sqrt{\\text{ALT}}}\\ $$

Age is measured in years, AST and ALT in international units per litre and platelet counts as 10^9 platelets per litre.

This will not be calculated for patients with anaemia or known inflammatory diseases, which for the purposes of this analysis we will define as the inflammatory arthropathies and inflammatory bowel diseases. We will not include conditions which feature lower levels of systemic inflammation (eg metabolic syndrome, COPD). Operationally, any participant meeting the drug-based definition for “Inflammatory arthropathies, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and connective tissue diseases” will not have a FIB4 calculated. For trials where inflammatory arthropathies or inflammatory bowel diseases conditions are indications, the FIB4 will not be estimated. Where these are comorbidities (defined as per concomitant medications based definitions), the participant will be assigned the median FIB4 value for the trial.

FIB4 will be standardised to FIB4 derived from component variables recorded in NHANES 2015-16 and modelled as a continuous variable.

Renal impairment
----------------

Some of the trials may have been conducted in countries or sites where creatinine levels have not been standardised to an isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) reference measurement procedure. Therefore we will use the “Creatinine Standardization Recommendations (for countries or regions that are introducing or have not completed standardization of creatinine calibration)” from the NIDDK recommendations (<https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/communication-programs/nkdep/laboratory-evaluation/glomerular-filtration-rate/creatinine-standardization/recommendations>).

This means that we will use the “Original Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation for routine methods that have not been calibrated to be traceable to IDMS” and the “CKD-EPI or IDMS-traceable MDRD Study equation for estimating GFR in adults” for laboratory results where the creatinine measurement “has its calibration traceable to IDMS”. For consistency, we will use the IDMS-traceable MDRD Study equation (GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (Scr)<sup>-1.154</sup> × (Age)<sup>-0.203</sup> × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American) in the latter case.

The eGFR estimated from either method is normalized to 1.73 m² body surface area. As per the NIDDK guidance for providers (<https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/clinical-tools-patient-education-outreach/ckd-drug-dosing-providers>) we will adjust for body surface area for people who are “very large or very small”. We will define these groups as having a height, weight or BMI below the 10<sup>th</sup> or above the 90<sup>th</sup> centile based on data from NHANES 2015-2016.

### Table 3 Quantiles for Height and Weight for NHANES 2015-2016

| Quantile                   | Weight (kg) | Height (cm) | BMI |
|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 10<sup>th</sup> percentile | 58          | 155         | 22  |
| 90<sup>th</sup> percentile | 111         | 182         | 38  |

For data see <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015>

We estimate body surface area using the Mosteller equation(10) and use this to adjust the eGFR as per the NIDDK recommendation (eGFR/1.73m<sup>2</sup> x estimated BSA = eGFR).

Having derived the eGFR we will standardise this to eGFR derived from creatinine measured in NHANES 2015-16 using the IDMS-traceable MDRD Study equation (as the creatinine measure in NHANES is IDMS-standardised) and model it as a continuous variable.

Although for clinical reporting eGFR levels above 60 are simply reported as “&gt;=60” we will not similarly truncate our values, as we are allowing for non-linearity in the modelling.

Anaemia
-------

Since the relationship between haemoglobin and disease states is markedly non-linear (with haemoglobin levels above and below the normal range considered abnormal), we will model haemoglobin using a dichotomous variable for anaemia present/absent, and use an additional continuous term for the severity of anaemia. We propose to define anaemia as per the WHO definitions (<http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85839/3/WHO_NMH_NHD_MNM_11.1_eng.pdf> ). This defines anaemia as follows.

|                                | Not anaemia | Mild anaemia | Moderate anaemia |
|--------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Non-pregnant women (≥15 years) | ≥12         | &lt;12       | &lt;11           |
| Men (≥15 years)                | ≥13         | &lt;13       | &lt;11           |

We will use the “Not anaemia” threshold to define anaemia as present/absent. For the continuous component of the variable we will standardise Haemoglobin to the NHANES 2015-16 laboratory results (<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2015>).

Modelling approach
==================

This document focusses on how the covariates for covariate-treatment interactions will be defined and modelled. As such details of the approach to outcome variables and to the selection of treatment are provided in a separate document. Briefly, we will standardise all continuous outcomes to an appropriate reference population (eg a cohort study of people with diabetes for HbA1c). For continuous outcomes we will fit models on the identity and log-scales. For categorical outcomes, we will fit models on the log-odds, log-risk, log-hazard and log-rate scales.

We will model comorbidities as separate conditions, and in a single comorbidity score.

Separate comorbidities
----------------------

For each covariate and covariate treatment interaction we will model the main effect and treatment-covariate interaction unadjusted, and adjusting for age and sex, then age, sex and race, and finally age, sex, race and other covariates of interest.

Categorical variables (including anaemia present/absent) will be included as 0 or 1 for absent/present.

As described above, all continuous variables (age, BMI, blood pressure, eGFR and FIB4) will be standardised to a single common reference population using the mean and standard deviation of that variable. This is being done to help with model fitting. We are using NHANES 2015/16 as the data are readily accessible to the public and because NHANES is a representative sample of a particular population.

We will allow for non-linearity in the continuous variables by using fractional polynomials. We will base our approach on advice given by Royston for modelling interactions in clinical trials;(11) we will (i) find the best second-degree fractional polynomial transformations of the variable within each treatment group using a measure of model fit appropriate to the type of regression model, (ii)l use the chosen powers (which perform best across the treatment arms) in a treatment-covariate interaction. As we will be analysing multiple trials, we will examine fit within treatment arms across all available trials, and will use the same transformation for all trials.

Comorbidity in a single score
-----------------------------

We will also produce a model with a single comorbidity score (based on obesity, renal impairment, liver impairment, anaemia and each of the concomitant medicine derived terms). This will be produced by a simple summation of the categorical (0/1) and continuous variables. For the latter, the standardised variable will simply be included in the summation.

For the comorbidity score calculation, the concomitant medication definition pairs will be collapsed into a single condition.
